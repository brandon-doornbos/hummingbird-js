# Welcome
This is the GitHub repository for the Hummingbird 2D rendering engine, developed solely by me, SantaClausNL.

JavaScript's Canvas API is great, but also very slow. Therefore I decided to make this, a fast and simple 2D rendering engine for WebGL.

This has been a great learning experience for me, in terms of Git(Hub), OpenGL and general computer graphics programming.

2. `cd hummingbird-js`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run-script build`

The built library will be in 'dist' in normal and minified form.
